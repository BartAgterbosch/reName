# reName
Application to bulk rename and/or zip files in a folder (alpha)

"Location" is the folder location which holds the files you wish to rename.

You can apply a filter by typing in a part of a word that the files you wish to filter out contains.

For example if you wish to only change the extension of the files which contain "document", you can type "document" in the filter box.

You can also use it to apply the changes only to files that hold a certain file extension, for example, to prepend only something to files with the extension .jpg.

To change the extension of all (or filtered) files in a folder, type the extension you wish to change them to in the extension box.

To prepend all (or filtered) files in a folder with something specific, type that which you want to prepend to the files in the prepend box, the same goes for appending something, except that goes in the append box.

You can also replace certain phrases or terms in a filename by specifying it in the "old" box under replace, then specifying what you wish to replace that with in the "new" box.

If you specify a term in the old box but leave the new box empty, it will simply remove the specified term from the filename.

Finally, if you wish you can automatically zip all the resulting files into a .zip file if you specify a name in the "Zip it!" box.

This can be all files if no filter is applied, or only a certain set of files if a filter is specified.

Leaving this box empty means it will not zip any files and simply skip that part.

This is just an alpha, so crashes may occur, nevertheless I haven't run in to any yet.

## Warning:
I am no longer maintaining this project, and I have noticed that there is a bug where in some circumstances it will not behave as expected, for example it might delete everything in a filename after a period character.
So if you still wish to use this program, I suggest making a backup of the folder/files before using this tool to rename the files, as it may end up giving unexpected and irreversible results
